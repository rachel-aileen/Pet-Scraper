# üêæ Pet Food Brand Scraper

A web-based application that scrapes brand information from pet food product URLs. Features a clean, modern interface with data storage and management capabilities.

## Features

- **URL Scraping**: Enter any pet food product URL OR direct image URL to extract brand and image information
- **Smart Brand Detection**: Uses multiple strategies to find brand names including:
  - Meta tags (product:brand, brand, itemprop)
  - JSON-LD structured data
  - CSS class patterns
  - Common pet food brand recognition
  - **URL-based extraction** - extracts brand names directly from URLs as fallback
  - **Brand exceptions** - automatically formats "Friskies" as "Purina Friskies"
- **Pet Type Detection**: Automatically determines whether products are for cats or dogs based on:
  - URL analysis (keywords like 'cat', 'dog', 'canine', 'feline')
  - Page title and meta descriptions
  - Open Graph metadata
  - Content headings analysis
- **Food Type Classification**: Automatically classifies food as wet, dry, raw, or treats based on:
  - URL keywords ('wet', 'canned', 'dry', 'kibble', 'raw', 'frozen', 'treat', 'snack')
  - Page content analysis
  - Product descriptions and titles
- **Smart Image Detection**: Finds the first reasonable image using:
  - **Direct image URL support** - handles .jpg, .png, .gif, .webp, .pdf URLs directly
  - Open Graph and Twitter meta tags (highest priority)
  - Structured data (JSON-LD)
  - **First reasonable image on page** - skips only obvious logos/icons
  - Automatic filtering of tiny images and common icon patterns
  - Converts relative URLs to absolute URLs automatically
- **Data Storage**: All scraped data is automatically saved with timestamps
- **App Export**: Format and export data in app-ready JavaScript object format
- **Data Management**: View, browse, and delete stored data entries
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Quick Start

1. **Activate the virtual environment** (if not already active):
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Run the application**:

## API Endpoints

- `POST /scrape` - Scrape URL endpoint (JSON: `{"url": "..."}`)
- `GET /data` - Retrieve all stored data
- `DELETE /data/<id>` - Delete specific data entry

## Technical Details

### Brand Extraction Strategies
The scraper uses multiple methods to find brand information:

1. **Meta Tags**: Looks for standard e-commerce meta tags
2. **Structured Data**: Parses JSON-LD for product information
3. **CSS Classes**: Searches for elements with "brand" in class names
4. **Text Patterns**: Finds text containing "brand:" labels
5. **Title Analysis**: Checks page titles for known pet food brands

### Supported Formats
- HTML pages with standard meta tags
- E-commerce sites with structured data
- Product pages with CSS-based layouts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Brand not found"**: This can happen when:
- The page doesn't contain standard brand markup
- The site uses JavaScript to load content dynamically
- The brand information is in images or non-text elements
- **Note**: The scraper now extracts brands from URLs as a fallback - if the brand name appears in the URL (like "instinctpetfood.com" ‚Üí "Instinct"), it should be detected automatically

**Network errors**: Check that:
- The URL is accessible
- Your internet connection is working
- The target site isn't blocking automated requests

**"Image not found"**: The scraper now includes multiple advanced detection methods:
- Open Graph meta tags (`og:image`)
- CSS background images
- JavaScript and data attributes
- Aggressive pattern matching
- **Fixed**: Content compression issues that previously prevented image detection

**403 Forbidden errors**: Some sites block automated requests:
- The scraper tries multiple user agents and retry attempts
- Try different product pages on the same site
- Some e-commerce sites have strong anti-bot protection
- Government, educational, and smaller business sites often work better

### Improving Results
For better brand detection, try:
- Using the main product page URL
- Checking if the site has structured data
- Looking for alternative product pages on the same site

### Sites That Work Well
The scraper works best with:
- Pet specialty stores and smaller retailers
- Sites with standard e-commerce structure
- Pages with clear product information
- Sites that don't require JavaScript for content loading

### Sites That May Be Challenging
- Large e-commerce platforms with anti-bot protection
- Sites requiring user accounts or authentication
- JavaScript-heavy single-page applications
- Sites with aggressive rate limiting

## Dependencies

- **Flask 3.0.0**: Web framework
- **requests 2.31.0**: HTTP requests
- **beautifulsoup4 4.12.2**: HTML parsing
- **gunicorn 21.2.0**: Production server (optional)

## Development

To modify the scraper:

1. **Brand extraction logic**: Edit the `extract_brand()` function in `app.py`
2. **UI changes**: Modify templates and static files
3. **New features**: Add endpoints to `app.py` and corresponding frontend code
