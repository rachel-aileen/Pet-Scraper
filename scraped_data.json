These are the same farms that stock your local Whole Foods & favorite restaurants. We only work with farms that never administer hormones & growth promoting antibiotics (a huge step up from conventional) & are certified humane through third-party audits like G.A.P. or the American Humane Program. By not relying on chemicals, our farmers focus on providing high quality food and a clean environment to raise healthy, happy animals.We grind, mix & package all of your cat's meals in our kitchens\u2014where we are the first and only pet food made in our facility that also produces human food. And you better believe we\u2019re proud of it. Everything is made in small batches (each package is hand-labeled & checked for quality) and tested for pathogens, because your kitty deserves the freshest food from farm-to-bowl.",
